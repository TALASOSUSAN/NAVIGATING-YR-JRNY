    <p>Trevor Noah grows into a restless young man as he struggles to find himself in a world where he was never supposed to exist, world built on institutionalized racism, unjust, world where race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason. The bond between Patricia the fearless, courageous, and God fearing woman who is a mother to Trevor seems to be strong enough that she is ever focused to  cover courage, displine, hope, determined to make her son feel loved, comfortable and never feel like he is a  reject <p> 
    
    <h1><u>RELIGION (RUN)</u></h1>

    <p>Trevor Noah foreshadows by by telling us he remembers what happened on Sunday because he was coming home from church and every Sunday in his childhood meant church. “We never missed church”, he said. 
    Trevor tells us that his mother is as stubborn as she is religious, that once her mind is made up, that’s it. Indeed she had a very strong faith in God that any obstacles that would normally lead a person to change his/her mind only made her to determine to forge ahead.
    Trevor Noah’s family was religious, where they had time to time plans of going for prayers at least four nights a week. Tuesday night was a prayer meeting, Wednesday night was Bible study, Thursday night was youth church, then Friday and Saturday they had off. Sunday they went to church, whereby, 
    They went to three church that, “each church gave Trevor Noah’s mother something different. The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord, the second church offered the deep analysis of the scripture (which the mother loved). The third church offered passion and catharsis.          
     At time when Trevor isn’t willing to go to church but tries to convince his mother respectfully that, “the Lord knows that today   we wouldn’t go to church, which is why he made sure that the car wouldn’t start, so that we stay at home as a family and take a day rest, because even the Lord rested”, she told him “that’s the devil talking” and she insisted that he would not undermine her “sun’ qhela!”
     There is also a point whereby the mother answered the son that, “God is my husband”, an answer to, “mom was it hard for you to raise me alone without a husband”, (Trevor, pray), she had life centered on faith, and also it reveals her independency and hard work without husband but had a very strong faith in God. <p>

                                              


   <h2><u>ROLE MODEL/UNCONDIONAL,LOVE/CARE</u></h2>
   

   <p>“I learned to use language like my mother did”, Patricia is a mother who ever led her son by example. She took Trevor Noah places where black people never went. (Second girl) she refused to be bound by ridiculous ideas of what black people couldn’t or should not do. She raised her son as if there were no limitation of on where he could go or what he could do. With love and care she is determined to give Noah everything she never had.<p>

   <p>The language is being described as “hierarchy” in South Africa, where English was the different between getting a job or staying unemployed. The language became the tool that served Trevor his whole life, there was a time he was he was almost mugged by the Zulu guys where they surrendered later after Trevor Noah speaking back to them the same language and they responded with an apology that they thought he was the white man, otherwise they were ready to do him violent harm! Trevor Noah wrote reveals that that small incidence in his life made him realize that, “language even more than colors define who you are.” <p>
